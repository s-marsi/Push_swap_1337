## Description :
- This project challenges you to efficiently sort data on a stack using a limited set of instructions, aiming to minimize the number of actions required. Explore a variety of algorithms and select the most suitable solution to achieve optimal data sorting.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- To use this program, you need a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and the make utility installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/s-marsi/Push_swap_1337.git push_swap
    cd push_swap
    ```
2. Compile the library:
    ```bash
    make all        # This will generate the push_swap program, and checker (bonus part).
    make clean      # This will remove object files.
    ```
## Usage :
- To use the push_swap program, run push_swap with a list of integers.
  
  ### EXAMPLE
  ```bash
  ./push_swap 2 0 1 4 7 5
